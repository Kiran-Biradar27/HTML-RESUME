<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Im a passionate and Aspiring Software Developer with a degree in Information Science and Engineering, fueled by 
  a love for building scalable web apps and intelligent systems. My tech toolkit includes the MERN stack, Java,frontend,Backend,
  Datbases and AI technologies—skills I’ve honed through both academic excellence and hands-on project development.</p>

<p>During my internships at Infotact Solutions and Varcons Technology, I worked on real-time data analytics platforms, 
  full-stack web applications, and AI-integrated solutions, often in agile team settings. My work not only enhanced 
  performance and usability but also deepened my understanding of practical software development in fast-paced environments.</p>

<p>Beyond internships, I’ve built diverse projects like a virtual therapy chatbot, facial recognition-based attendance systems,
   and multilingual AI assistants. I was also the winner of the MongoDB category at NMIT Hacks 2025. With a CGPA of 8.8 and a 
   streak as a branch topper, I combine strong fundamentals with a hunger for innovation—and I’m eager to contribute the same energy
   and creativity to impactful tech teams.</p>
